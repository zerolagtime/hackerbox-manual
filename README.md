# Hackerbox Basics Workshop

This work is released under CC-NC-SA-4.0. See CC-NA-SA-4.0.pdf for details.

Here is a PDF version of the manual available for the kit as of October 2024.
Everything is cleaned up a lot by hand to make it presentable in book form.
The license is part of the book so that you can pay someone to print the 
book if desired. Unfortunately, with almost all of the pages being in color,
printing costs can be $US45-75 for every vendor we could identify.

Also included are copies of all the referenced data sheets and my own personal
double sided electronics cheat sheet, making a release for the first time# Hackerbox Basics Workshop
